# Console Chess – C# Implementation

This is a **console-based chess application** written in **C#**.  
It allows two players to play a full game of chess in the terminal, with move validation and enforcement of the game rules.

I built this project to combine my interest in chess with programming, and to practice working with object-oriented design, game logic and board representations.
